strcpy: does it cause mem problems when string given value with strcpy is given to another function? yes according to valgrind, so:
    * compare strdup and strcpy with valgrind
    * replace all strcpy by strdup if needed
Functions should NOT RETURN AN ALLOCATED STRING, either:
    1) static stack allocate in the func the return it (variable erased on every call)
    2) use `func(src, dest, size)` style
    
Finish it by debugging with valgrind

Can only takes one input FILE? Or do we allow for multiple input files? If we do, is it hard to implement?
Works on multiple <img> tags per line?
Works on badly formatted <img> tags?
Use libb64 right?
Use gnulib or libiberty??
    gnulib requires autotools and so that's a fucking nope
